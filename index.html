              <h2 class="text-center">what is C</h2>
              <p> C++ is a general purpose programming
                language and widely used now a days '
                for competitive programming. It has
                imperative, object-oriented and generic
                programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                C++ is an efficient
                and powerful language and finds wide use
                in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                real-time simulations. Because of the
                inclusion of rich function libraries,
                working in C++ becomes simpler and
                convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                programming like Java, C++ provides
                the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                exception handling and function overloading.</p>
                <p>he “Hello World” program is the first
                    step towards learning any programming
                    language and also one of the simplest
                    programs you will learn. All you have
                    to do is display the message “Hello World”
                    on the screen.
                    <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>

              <h2 class="text-center">object and classes</h2>
              <p>Object-oriented programming  As the name
                suggests uses objects in programming.
                Object-oriented programming aims to
                implement real-world entities like
                inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                etc in programming. The main
                aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                and the functions that operate on them
                so that no other part of the code can
                access this data except that function.</p>
                <p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable
                    entity with some characteristics and behavior.
                    An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
                    class is defined, no memory is allocated but
                    when it is instantiated (i.e. an
                    object is created) memory is allocated.
                    <br>
                    <b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that
                    leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
                    It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
                    own data members and member functions, which can
                    be accessed & used by creating an instance
                    of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
                    an object. For Example: Consider the Class
                    of Cars. There may be many cars with different
                    names and brand but all of them will share
                    some common properties like all of them will
                    have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
                    So here, Car is the class and wheels,
                    speed limits, mileage are their properties.

              <h2 class="text-center">javascript</h2>
              <p>
                "JS" is commonly used as an abbreviation for JavaScript. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is an essential component of web development alongside HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
                JavaScript allows developers to manipulate webpage elements, handle events, create animations, communicate with servers asynchronously (via AJAX), and much more. It is widely supported by modern web browsers and can be used on both client-side (in the browser) and server-side (with platforms like Node.js).
              JavaScript is a versatile language that has expanded beyond the realm of web development. It is now used for mobile app development, game development, server-side programming, and even in embedded systems.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">what is html</h2>
              <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and consists of a series of elements that define the content and layout of the page.</p>
              defines the document type and version of HTML being used.
                is the root element that wraps all content on the page.
                 contains meta-information about the document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
                 contains the visible content of the web page.
                Structural elements likehelp organize and structure the content.
                Semantic elements like h1, h2, p, li, and  provide meaning to the content.
                Attributes such as id, href, and lang provide additional information or functionality to elements.</p>
